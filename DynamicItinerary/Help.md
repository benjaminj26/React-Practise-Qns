Develop a ReactJS application named "DynamicItinerary". The application will include a parent Trip component and a child Destination component. The Trip component maintains an array of destinations for a trip, and renders each destination using the Destination component.

Implement the following functionalities:

Trip Component:
    - Manages an array of destinations.
    - Renders each destination using the Destination component.

Destination Component:
    - Displays the information of a single destination.
    - Use the useEffect hook to simulate fetching data on initialization.
    - Implement a cleanup function in the useEffect hook to log a message to the console when the destination is removed.

Bonus:
    - Implement functionality to dynamically add and remove destinations.
    - Ensure that removing a destination triggers the cleanup function in the Destination component, logging the removal.

Test Cases:
    - Initialization of Trip Component:
        On app initialization, display a list of destinations.
        Render each destination using the Destination component.
    - Data Fetching in Destination Component:
        Simulate data fetching in Destination with useEffect on component initialization.
        Ensure that the fetched data is displayed correctly.
    - Logging with Cleanup Function:
        Log a message to the console when a Destination component is unmounted.
    - Dynamically Add Destinations (Bonus):
        Provide an interface in the Trip component to add new destinations.
        Ensure the list updates with a new Destination component for each addition.
    - Dynamically Remove Destinations (Bonus):
        Include a remove option for each Destination.
        Removing a destination should update the list and trigger the cleanup function.
    - Data Propagation:
        Ensure accurate data passing from Trip to Destination components.

Boundary and Edge Cases:
    Handle scenarios with an empty destination list, removing non-existent destinations, and adding destinations with incomplete data.

Interaction Tests:
    Test adding and removing destinations, ensuring all updates are rendered correctly.

UI/UX Checks:
    Ensure the destination list and interactive elements are user-friendly and organized.

You need to complete the following files:
    1. src/app/destination/Destination.js
    2. src/app/trip/Trip.js

Notes:
    1. Do not change file names, class names, or method declarations.
    2. Focus on functionality; UI styling is not required for this task.
