Develop a ReactJS application named "WeatherApp". This application will focus on showcasing React's ability to transform and display data dynamically. The application will consist of a main WeatherComponent.

Implement the following functionalities:

WeatherComponent:
    - Display the current temperature in Celsius.
    - Implement a dropdown to allow users to choose the temperature format (Celsius, Fahrenheit, Kelvin).
    - Use a custom function, similar to an Angular pipe, to transform and display the temperature in the selected format.

temperatureFunction:
    - Create a function that takes the original temperature in Celsius and the desired format as parameters.
    - Convert the Celsius temperature to the chosen format.

Requirements:
    - Initialize a default temperature (e.g., 25Â°C) in the WeatherComponent using the useState and useEffect hooks.
    - The default display should be in Celsius.
    - When a different format is selected from the dropdown, transform and display the temperature in that format.
    Bonus:
    - Add functionality to update the temperature. Reflect the change in the chosen format.

Test Cases:
    - Initialization of WeatherComponent:
        On app initialization, display a default temperature in Celsius.
    - Display with temperatureFunction:
        Correctly display the temperature in Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin based on the dropdown selection.
    - Functionality of temperatureFunction:
        Test the function with known Celsius values to ensure it returns expected Fahrenheit and Kelvin values.
    - Dropdown Interaction:
        Include Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin as dropdown options.
        Ensure changing the selection immediately updates the temperature format.
    - Update Temperature (Bonus):
        Implement a mechanism to update the temperature.
        Ensure the display reflects the new temperature in the current format.

Boundary and Edge Cases:
    Handle negative temperatures and extreme values correctly.
        
Responsive Behavior:
    Ensure the dropdown and temperature display are responsive on various screen sizes.

You need to complete the following files:
    1. WeatherComponent in src/app/weather/Weather.js
    2. Temperature conversion function in src/app/utils/temperatureFunction.js

Notes:
    1. Do not change file names, class names, or method declarations.
    2. Focus on functionality; UI styling is not required for this task.
