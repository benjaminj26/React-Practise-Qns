Develop a segment of a shipment tracking platform using ReactJS, which enables users to register new shipments and retrieve detailed information about a specific shipment via its Tracking ID.

Sample db.json:

json { "shipments": [ { "trackingID": "T12345", "sender": "Tech Corp", "receiver": "Jane Doe", "origin": "New York", "destination": "San Francisco", "status": "In Transit", "expectedDelivery": "2023-09-20" }, { "trackingID": "T67890", "sender": "John Smith", "receiver": "Books Store", "origin": "Los Angeles", "destination": "Chicago", "status": "Delivered", "expectedDelivery": "2023-09-10" } // ... More shipments can be added ] } 

Tasks:

1. Create a ReactJS application for managing and tracking shipments.
2. Implement a form to register new shipments with necessary attributes: Sender, Receiver, Origin, Destination, Current Status, and Expected Delivery Date. 
3. Include validations for each input.
3. Develop an interface allowing users to enter a Tracking ID, which fetches and displays detailed information about the corresponding shipment.

You need to complete the following files:
1. ./src/ShipmentForm.js
2. ./src/ShipmentService.js
3. ./src/ShipmentTracker.js

Notes:
1. Do not change the structure of the db.json file.
2. Focus on functionality; UI styling is not required for this task.
